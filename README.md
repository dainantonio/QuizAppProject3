Project 3: Quiz App
The Quiz App project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section
of the Nanodegree program. You will be making your own Android app - taking it from the idea stage to
building out the full app. You can share your app with family and friends, as well as with other students
in this course.
The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice. We
want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. It’s up to you what the quiz questions will be
about and how you want to present them to your user. (We recommend about 5-10 quiz questions for
a reasonable scope of your app).
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course.
They include:
● Planning your app design before coding.
● Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.
● Creating, positioning, and styling views.
● Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.
● Commenting and documenting your code
